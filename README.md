# Expense Tracker App – Flutter (Riverpod Architecture)

A cleanly structured Flutter Expense Tracker application built using Riverpod for state management and a feature-first architecture. This project focuses on scalable app structure, separation of concerns, and modern Flutter best practices, making it suitable both as a learning project and as a portfolio-ready codebase.

## Features

- Add and manage expense records
- Expenses sorted by date (newest first)
- Category-based expense modeling
- Analytics screen for spending insights
- Custom search using SearchDelegate
- Notifications screen architecture (extensible)
- Centralized state management with Riverpod
- Persistent preferences via storage repository
- Light & Dark theme support
- Reusable UI tokens and theming system

## Architecture

- Feature-based folder structure
- Riverpod for global and scoped state management
- Repository pattern for storage abstraction
- Centralized theming and design tokens
- Clear separation of UI, state, and business logic
